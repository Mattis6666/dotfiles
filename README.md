## Ven's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Not sure why you're here but have fun ig lmao

### Usage

#### Backup dotfiles

- Populate files.txt with all files you would like to backup (FULL PATHS) separated by newlines
- Run backup.py ~ It will automatically copy all files to dotfiles/ and store their full paths in filemap.json

#### Automatically restore/init dotfiles

- Run install.py as root
- Optional: run install.sh as root to install a bunch of dependencies
